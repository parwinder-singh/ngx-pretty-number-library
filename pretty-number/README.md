# ngxPrettyNumber (Beta)

This library includes functionality to enable number only input field along with two decimal places. Package includes a single directive `ngxPrettyNumber` which
needs to be applied on input (type='text') field. Adding this will enable comma formatting as user start typing. Also, it will maintain two decimal places mask.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project pretty-number` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project pretty-number`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project pretty-number` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build pretty-number` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build pretty-number`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/pretty-number` and run `npm publish`.
